            <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

            <p>
                The X Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
                assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in
                    large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our X production environment, low risk and
                    recommended to be widely used.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to
                    solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
                    limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked
                    this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add
                    for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
                    impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our
                    organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you
                    may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
                </li>
                <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies
                    that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for
                    new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at X to pick the best technologies
                for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect
                on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets
                out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we
                think our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their projects.
            </p>

            <h3>How do we maintain/contribute</h3>

            <p>
                The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Developers, Architects and Team Leads</em> &mdash; who facilitate
                and drive the technology selection discussions at X. Assignment of
                technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on during the Architecture Round. The
                Tech Radar is open for [contribution](https://git.X.io/architectural-decisions/tech-radar) for all Engineering teams at X and depends on their active
                participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the
                technologies.<br/>
